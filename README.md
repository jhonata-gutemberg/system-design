## ðŸ§  What is system design?
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow of a software 
system to meet specific requirementsâ€”such as scalability, reliability, maintainability, and performance. 
In simpler terms, itâ€™s about planning how different parts of a system will work together to solve a problem efficiently 
and effectively, especially when the system is large or expected to handle a lot of users or data.

## ðŸ”§ Key aspects of system design
* High-level architecture (e.g., client-server, microservices, event-driven)
* Database design (relational vs NoSQL, indexing, replication)
* API design (REST, gRPC, GraphQL)
* Scalability (horizontal/vertical scaling, load balancing, caching)
* Reliability (fault tolerance, redundancy, backups)
* Performance (latency, throughput, bottlenecks)
* Security (authentication, authorization, data protection)
